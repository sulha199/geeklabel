## Slider
Slider is used to create a responsive content-slider in members and blog block. To use the slider just add the following classes
```
<div .. class="flex-slider flex-width-200 ...">
```
The class width 200 is to set the min-width to be 200px, hence if you want to set the min-width to 300 then write the class as follows:
```
<div .. class="flex-slider flex-width-300  ...">
```

By default, the slider will have previous/next button on the side of the content. However, if the screen's width is smaller than 768px, then the buttons will turn into bullet buttons below the content as the slider pagination.
